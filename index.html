  <h1>WHY I LOVE CHIPS!</h1>

<p>I love chips because they are crispy,crunchy and always a joy to eat. Their texture creates a satisfying bite without fail and is the perfect dish to make when you have little to no options for lunch, dinner or even breakfast! whether i am relaxing, with friends and family or working on my software programming chips always make the moment a hundred times better.They are simple to make and if i have time i add masala onions to coat my chips or add toppings to make loaded chips - its never a dull moment! They will forever be a staple in my diet.Baked not fried.</p>
